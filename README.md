# Return-Weapon.lua
Garry's Mod : Return-Weapons Lua Script.

DESCRIPTION : 
- This is a Garry's Mod serversided lua script that I made a few weeks ago while I was bored. What it does is, it allows your players to disconnect with weapons on them, this is not limited to guns, but also to other items such as grenades, ammo and other entities that they can carry in their inventories. When they return, they will be given those weapons and spawn in the position that they left at as long as they rejoin within 15 mins. This is similar to a script I saw in usage on a server I played on a while back. 

Some server owners don't have the means to make these scripts or pay a developer to make them. So I'm releasing my one publicly as I don't play GMOD anymore, it may need some touch ups but it should work without issue. If you do have an issue you can report it on here and I will do my best to help you out. It should work for most RP gamemodes including DarkRP , StarwarsRP and SantosRP. 

USAGE : 

Unzip it and throw it into your lua folder, simple as that. 

Check the console to ensure it initializes when your server boots up.
